# Zrankings

Welcome to the Zrankings Top 30 Web Scraper gem. This gem scrapes the top 30 ski resorts on Zrankings.com and allows you to scrape additional information on a resort of choice. 

## Installation

Fork and clone to your computer

## Usage

Run bin/zrankings

Usage instructions are clearly outlined in the program itself, but in summary:
1) Upon launch, the program will print a numbered list of the top 30 ranked ski resorts from Zrankings.com.
2) You may either type the number of the resort you would like to learn more about or type 'exit' to quit the program.
3) Upon typing a valid number, the program will list details on the ski resort of choice. It will also prompt you for more input
4) You may either 'exit' like before, or type 'back' to return to the main menu, at which point you may repeat steps starting at #2 above.
