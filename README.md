# Zrankings

Welcome to the Zrankings Top 30 Web Scraper gem. This gem scrapes the top 30 ski resorts on Zrankings.com and allows you to scrape additional information on a resort of choice. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'zrankings'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install zrankings

## Usage

Usage instructions are clearly outlined in the program itself, but in summary: 
1) Upon launch, the program will print a numbered list of the top 30 ranked ski resorts from Zrankings.com.
2) You may either type the number of the resort you would like to learn more about or type 'exit' to quit the program.
3) Upon typing a valid number, the program will list details on the ski resort of choice. It will also prompt you for more input
4) You may either 'exit' like before, or type 'back' to return to the main menu, at which point you may repeat steps starting at #2 above.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
